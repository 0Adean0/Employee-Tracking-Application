# Employee -Tracking-Application

## Description
This projects main objective was to create an employee tracking (in this case D&D themed) application through command-inline. This application can be used by anyone, preferably a business owner or manager, to log, update and keep track of new and pre-existing employees, their titles, and their corresponding departments.This information is presented in a tabled format. Utilizing MySQL, 3 npm packages, sourcing schemas and seed data, writing databases proved to be a solid educational experience.

## Usage
To best use this application, any given user can initiate the program by cloning the respository and opening an integrated terminal. Next, the user must input `node index.js` and follow any prompts to achieve their desired outcome.
